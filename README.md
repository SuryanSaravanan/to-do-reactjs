# To-Do App

We will develop a task management application to grasp the fundamentals of ReactJS. Our focus will be on utilizing class-based components, and for styling, we'll employ the React-Bootstrap module. This task manager allows us to both add new tasks and remove existing ones through user interaction. The deletion functionality is achieved by implementing a click event handler, which removes tasks from the list when clicked
